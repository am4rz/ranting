dont read this but if you do go ahead but im warning you since its just sad to read honestly but i needed to rant

i just felt like i had to write this down since i dont want to bottle anything up anymore but i dont want to make people uncomfortable in dms or something i dont know

i still feel like shit and nothing really helps anymore
used to this one discord server helped soothe things down along with video games and small project things or Linux stuff, but that just doesnt work for me now

drama kinda forced me out of said server, and i no longer love video games or making retarded projects or messing around with linux

video games bore me now, I have no idea what to do in them or what to play and it gets boring quick, and it never distracts me from what im thinking about

making retarded projects like websites or docs is boring and frustrating now, it either never fucking works right or im bored out of my mind or i have no idea what to do or I'm trying to get information correct but its a chore to figure it out

Linux is a chore now too, i still prefer it over windows so i use it but i dont fucking care about theming or anything I just want something that fucking works now, i used to love troubleshooting or making my epic catppuccin KDE or TWM thing, but fuck man it's boring and annoying and i just want it to work

said discord server is so addicting but i can't fucking do shit there since i got fucking backstabbed and all of this bullshit, people claim oh they miss me but others just fucking exaggerate or lie and say ive always been a piece of shit

i have found a few friends and a new discord server, the server just doesnt feel right, its not what i want but its the next best thing, and the friends are cool but man im bored out of my mind and im scared im so fucking scared of doing the wrong thing

i even have this one friend, i like him as a friend and everything but he likes playing video games and i do so anyways but like man its so tiring trying to please him because i dont want him to leave me or hate me and stuff

ive considered just ending it all (IM NOT GOING TO) but i know people do care about me somewhat but my real life fucking sucks too and all this and im also scared that if i attempt i will fail and have to answer myself, and also i think i can fix this so why kill myself you get it right and also i don't want my parents searching my stuff since they usually do but they really haven't but i don't want them to restart it 

i used to like doing server things but a big problem is server things is related to my issue and spectrum internet wont change my ip address no matter what i do

something i still have a passion for tho it's music and this said discord server, the server isn't perfect but it distracted me mostly and the music is relatable or good to listen to for me so it's distracting so that's nice 

I've picked up Android modding but i can't really do anything and it's so so so so so fucking annoying when it doesn't work and i have mostly everything working so i can't fucking do much now

i still just don't know what to do, my life still fucking feels like shit even with this discord server and music and i fucking find it annoying to play video games or do Linux things 

ive kinda picked up somg eriting but not singing or making but i cant really make the songs sound good like i csnt fucking rhyme or be creative but ive tried

sorry to anyone who had the displeasure of reading this you are the one who chose to open this but i would still be bottleing it up if this was a private repo yk?
